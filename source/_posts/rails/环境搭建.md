出现这个提示之后

```
RVM is not a function, selecting rubies with 'rvm use ...' will not work.

You need to change your terminal emulator preferences to allow login shell.
Sometimes it is required to use `/bin/bash --login` as the command.
Please visit https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/ for an example.
```
  需要执行这个命令
 ```bash

$  cp ~/.profile  ~/.bash_login
 
 ```
